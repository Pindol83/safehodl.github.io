What does it mean for Bitcoin to fail?

There are divergent opinions on what Bitcoin’s ultimate goal is.  For most people, Bitcoin is just a tool to move and store monetary value.  Likewise, most critics attack Bitcoin as a store-of-value or a "bad investment".

Whether Bitcoin becomes a global unit of account, gains merchant adoption, or has bigger socioeconomic effects is not yet relevant for most Bitcoin owners.

With this in mind, I have collected all the arguments against Bitcoin along with rebuttals.  Each reason can be shared if you want to link to a specific argument.

{: style="color:gray; font-size: 150%; text-align: center;"}

#### Governments will stop Bitcoin
{: #governments-will-stop }
- *Which governments?*  Your mileage will vary depending on whether you live in [North Korea, China, or Switzerland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legality_of_bitcoin_by_country_or_territory).
- *How will they stop Bitcoin?*  Bitcoin is a global software network that cannot be stopped anymore than we could stop all ants from existing around the globe.  Even governments are limited in their effective power.
- *Who is the government?*  Many governments are constrained by laws and elections.  Moreover since [politicians](https://fortune.com/2020/11/04/wyoming-bitcoin-cynthia-lummis-u-s-senate/), [corporations](https://news.bitcoin.com/nasdaq-microstrategy-bitcoin-425-million/), and [citizens](https://www.bitcoinmarketjournal.com/how-many-people-use-bitcoin/) already own Bitcoin, some in “the government” already have a vested interest in Bitcoin.
- *What happens as pensions, endowments, corporations own Bitcoin?*  Governments that have allowed these institutions to own Bitcoin will not be able to make it illegal without impoverishing their voter base.
- *Are all governments working together to stop Bitcoin?*  Many governments want to attract investment and technology so they create competitive laws to attract Bitcoin.  Rival countries need neutral reserve assets like gold or Bitcoin since they cannot trust the currency of their rival.
- See also: [Governments will ban ownership or confiscate all Bitcoin](#governments-will-ban-ownership)

#### Exchanges can be shutdown by governments
{: #exchanges-can-be-shutdown }
- *What about countries that already legalized exchanges?*  In most countries Bitcoin exchanges operate legally and governments prefer that to black markets.
- *How do you stop peer-to-peer exchanges?*  Countries that have [shutdown exchanges have seen the emergence of peer-to-peer exchanges](https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-launches-p2p-trading-in-china-with-support-for-alipay-and-wechat/) that can leverage any existing payment networks.
- *How do you stop a transaction from taking place?*  Bitcoin transactions can be hidden in text messages, [emjoi](https://twitter.com/aantonop/status/1088556402115784704), images, and sent from anywhere on the internet.
- *What happened in history when governments banned goods that many people wanted?*  Black markets form in cannabis and alcohol, and Bitcoin is far easier to move and harder to detect than those.
- See also: [Governments will stop Bitcoin](#governments-will-stop)

#### Banning nodes will stop Bitcoin
{: #banning-nodes-will-stop }
- *How do you stop nodes from running in every single country?*  So long as a node is running somewhere in the world Bitcoin can continue to validate transactions.
- *How do you detect nodes that are run behind the Tor network?*  Nodes can be run invisibly behind the Tor network which is legal in most countries.
- *What about governments that have already upheld freedom of speech laws?*  Governments with [freedom of speech laws have set precedents](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/article/is-code-free-speech/) to allow sharing of open-source software such as Bitcoin.

#### Downed internet because of governments or natural disasters will stop Bitcoin
{: #shut-off-internet-because }
- *Won’t people demand and work towards bringing the internet back online?*  If the internet stops working entirely so do modern economies and governments.
- *What about the part of the world in which the internet continues to function?*  Internet shutdowns, solar flares, or other disasters might disrupt a large part of the internet but Bitcoin would be secured by the part of the internet that continues to function.

#### Split internet communication will cause the blockchain to split
{: #split-internet-communication-will }
- *How do all communication channels get cut off?*  The internet is adaptive--Bitcoin [satellites](https://blog.bitmex.com/bitcoin-satellite/), [mesh networks](https://txtenna.com/), and [radio transmitters](https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-coders-send-international-lightning-payment-over-ham-radio) can continue to transmit Bitcoin blocks and transactions between countries if cellular or fiber internet goes down
- *What if all communication channels somehow do get cut off?*  Delays in communication between chains means more blocks are required for final settlement.  If the chain split is permanent each chain can fork to disallow being rewritten.

#### Bitcoin can’t scale, transactions are too slow or expensive
{: #cant-scale-transactions-are }
- *What about the scaling happening on second-layers?*  Second layers such as [Lightning](https://lightning.network/), [Liquid](https://blockstream.com/liquid/), or even apps like [Square Cash](https://cash.app/help/us/en-us/1016-bitcoin) can scale to support any number of transactions, offering different cost vs. security trade-offs.
- *Which other currency can move higher value with irreversible settlement and lower transaction fees than Bitcoin?*  Bitcoin can deliver [irreversible multi-billion-dollar transactions](https://cointelegraph.com/news/whale-alert-crypto-user-moves-1-1b-in-bitcoin) for cents within an hour.

#### Outspending the miners would allow someone to censor or stop transactions
{: #outspending-the-miners-would }
- *Where do they get the ASICs required?*  Launching a 51% attack requires not just energy but access to many ASICs that would be hard to secretly acquire without detection by producers in the supply chain.
- *What can they accomplish?*  Spending hundreds of billions would only allow them to censor Bitcoin transactions.
- *What if the network forks?*  The network can fork onto a new mining algorithm making all the attacker’s ASICs useless.

#### Miners losing access to energy will stop transactions
{: #shutting-off-energy }
- *Who or what is shutting off energy globally?*  Miners are globally distributed and use various types of energy.  They can use energy simply by plugging into the power grid or by working directly with energy suppliers.  There is no entity that can find and stop them all.
- *What happens if energy usage drops?*  Even if a large number of miners can no longer use energy, hashpower drops, but Bitcoin will continue to function.  No one except Bitcoin miners can attack Bitcoin with hashpower.  However, users may want to wait longer for block confirmations in case hashpower comes back online.
- *What about a fork to low energy mining?*  In the worst case, Bitcoin could fork to use a new mining algorithm.  Bitcoins would still be secure on both chains.

#### Miners are centralized in China and will be forced to censor or stop all transactions
{: #miners-are-centralized-and }
- *What about miners that decide to switch mining pools?*  Miners can switch easily between pools and use protocols such as [Stratum V2](https://braiins.com/stratum-v2) to create blocks themselves.
- *How does an attacker force miners around the globe to censor?*  [Miners are becoming more distributed](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/the-sun-never-sets-on-bitcoin-mining-decentralization-continues-as-china-flounders) as they chase global low-cost energy sources, often in remote areas where they may bring in significant tax revenue.
- *What about miners that attempt to defect?*  Miners are often heavily invested in Bitcoin themselves so they have incentive to keep the integrity of the network.
- *What if the network forks?*  The network can fork onto a new mining algorithm making all the attacker’s ASICs useless.

#### A miner death spiral where less hashrate leads to price drops in a spiral to zero
{: #a-miner-death-spiral }
- *How is Bitcoin’s price dependent on hashrate?*  Although profitable hashrate depends on price, the price of Bitcoin is not dependent on hashrate.
- *What about improvements in miners that increase hashrate?*  Hashrate trends upwards regardless of price as chips improve and miners find cheaper energy
- *How does hashrate undermine store-of-value?*  If hashrate does fall precipitously, users simply need to wait longer before trusting transactions as confirmed.

#### Block rewards will stop in the future and Bitcoin will lose all security
{: #block-rewards-will-stop }
- *How can we not adapt to something that will happen in 2140?*  Block rewards drop every 4 years giving the network plenty of time to adapt to observed changes.
- *What about the increasing fee rewards?*  [Bitcoin fee rewards have been steadily increasing](https://medium.com/@danhedl/bitcoins-security-is-fine-93391d9b61a8) with Bitcoin’s price and settlement transaction demand.

#### Governments will ban ownership or confiscate all Bitcoin.
{: #governments-will-ban-ownership }
- *What about all the governments that have legal and regulatory frameworks already established for Bitcoin?*  Governments with property rights laws are mostly treating Bitcoin like other assets.  They are incentivized to tax it, not to make it flee across the border.
- *How do you confiscate information?*  Bitcoin can be stored in your head, spread between people, or moved instantly across the internet, making it impossible to confiscate without permission.  It can even be destroyed in situations of duress.
- *Why won’t governments go after larger and easier-to-target assets first?*  Real estate, stocks, and bonds are far easier and bigger honeypots to confiscate.
- *What happened when they confiscated gold with order 6102 in the US?*  Only the US did this because the dollar was backed by gold.  Gold prices went up in other countries where you could own it.  Bitcoin doesn’t back the dollar or settle international trade (at least not for a while).
- See also: [Governments will stop Bitcoin](#governments-will-stop)

#### Bitcoin cannot be insured, unlike bank deposits
{: #cannot-be-insured-unlike }
- *What about all the companies that offer Bitcoin insurance?*  There are many Bitcoin custodians that use insurance to cover deposits.
- *How much are bank deposits actually insured?*  In a large banking crisis governments will have to step in to print money to back deposits which can devalue the currency.

#### Bitcoin is too complicated for most people to self-custody, so all the Bitcoin can be stolen from custodians.
{: #is-too-complicated-for }
- *What about improvements in wallets?*  Bitcoin wallet useability and education has increased by bounds over the last decade and will continue to improve.
- *How do you steal from federated custodians?*  The custodians can federate or distribute themselves across jurisdictions making confiscation impossible before coins begin to move.

#### Quantum computing will break the security
{: #quantum-computing-will-break }
- *How will the network not be able to adapt to technology that is years away and whose progress can be observed?*  Adding quantum-resistant addresses to Bitcoin would be achieved through a soft-fork.
- *What about addresses protected by SHA256 hashing?*  There is no known quantum algorithm to break SHA256 cryptography that Bitcoin uses for mining and protects addresses that haven’t revealed their public key.
- *Why would a country who developed encryption-breaking quantum target Bitcoin?*  Such a quantum computer would probably first be pointed towards competitor’s state secrets and financial systems rather than a tiny asset class.
- *What stops the network from a fork to remove all addresses that aren’t quantum resistant?*  If there are concerns about a quantum attacker getting large amounts of Bitcoin, a fork could remove non-upgraded addresses allowing the market to decide which chain to move value onto.

#### A bug in Bitcoin could allow hackers to steal or disrupt the network.
{: #a-bug-in-could }
- *How has this not been discovered already?*  Bitcoin is the largest honeypot in the world with thousands of the world’s top cryptographers and engineers trying to break it everyday for a decade
- *What stops the network from forking or upgrading?*  Although disruptive, Bitcoin can always fork to fix critical bugs.

#### Scarcity can be changed by the developers unlike other assets
{: #scarcity-can-be-changed }
- *What about assets that can be issued or mined?*  Many other assets such as currencies and equity can be issued, commodities like gemstones or gold can be mined.
- *What is the incentive for the Bitcoin community to increase the supply?*  Such an increase would devalue the savings of everyone so it is not the interest of anyone participating in the network.
- *What happens if Bitcoin’s community decides to increase the 21 million supply cap?*  Changing Bitcoin’s supply cap requires a hard fork, creating two chains in which users will own Bitcoin on both, so they lose no value.  From there the market will decide on whether the inflated or original Bitcoin is more valuable.

#### Bitcoin’s price is too high, it's too expensive
{: #price-is-too-high }
- *How does Bitcoin’s market cap compare to other assets?*  Bitcoin is still very small compared to gold and is superior on many factors.  You can buy a fraction of a Bitcoin.
- *What if Bitcoin absorbs savings demand that is current in other assets?*  Art, real estate, and other valuables are currently used as savings by many people.  Bitcoin can be much larger if it absorbs some of that savings demand.
- *What happens to Bitcoin’s stock-to-flow over time?*  Over time, the supply of Bitcoin is programmatically reduced.  After each [supply reduction the price increases](https://medium.com/@100trillionUSD/modeling-bitcoins-value-with-scarcity-91fa0fc03e25), probably because of supply-and-demand fundamentals.
- *Will Bitcoin be more demanded over time?*  As Bitcoin becomes easier to use and more liquid, new individuals and fund managers can switch to it as a store-of-value.  The adoption curve of any network such as the internet tends to be exponential.

#### Bitcoin can be forked infinitely which dilutes the value
{: #can-be-forked-infinitely }
- *If users get to keep Bitcoin on both chains how is their value diluted?*  In fiat currencies a governance “fork” results in a war in which the losing side loses all their store-of-value.  Bitcoin forks are a feature not a bug of the money.
- *What if the market selects a single version of Bitcoin?*  After all the Bitcoin forks in 2017 the market gravitates towards a single protocol as store-of-value, namely the original Bitcoin core

#### Bitcoin has no intrinsic value (unlike say gold)
{: #has-no-intrinsic-value }
- *What does “intrinsic value” mean?*
- If you mean cost of production then Bitcoin has billions in mining infrastructure and millions of hours of software development and writing dedicated to it.
- If you mean industrial use, neither do emeralds, collectible coins, digital game tokens or Picassos, but they all have value.  Even gold’s industrial use is tiny compared to its monetary use stored as bars or coins in vaults around the world.
- Market value is determined by the subjective wants of buyers and sellers in the market.

#### Bitcoin is a ponzi or pyramid scheme
{: #is-a-ponzi-or }
- *How is Bitcoin a ponzi scheme if it has no cash flows?*  Ponzi schemes are based on promises of income that require more and more entrants.  [Bitcoin cannot be a ponzi scheme](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/bitcoin-is-not-a-pyramid-scheme/) because there is no income, just like diamonds or gold cannot be a ponzi scheme..
- Perhaps you mean: [Bitcoin is a bubble?](#is-a-bubble-like)

#### Bitcoin is a bubble like tulip mania
{: #is-a-bubble-like }
- *What is wrong with bubbles since they occur in all assets?*  Bubbles can occur in all assets including fiat currencies, commodities, real estate and equities.
- *How come the tulip bubble ended after 1 year, yet Bitcoin has increased in market cap for over a decade going?*  What makes Bitcoin different from tulips are its monetary properties--divisibility, scarcity, fungibility, portability, durability--which makes it a good savings vehicle, more similar to gold than to tulips.

#### Bitcoin has no yield, it’s not an investment, therefore it has no value
{: #has-no-yield-its }
- *How do commodities like gemstones, art, and gold have value?*  Value is decided by market supply and demand, not by yield.
- *What is the difference between investment, speculation, and saving?*  Bitcoin is a speculative savings vehicle, not an investment in productive capital.

#### Bitcoin is too volatile to be in an investment portfolio or be a store-of-value
{: #is-too-volatile-to }
- *If Bitcoin’s value increases over time who cares about volatility?*  Bitcoin has continually increased in market cap over time.  For investors with a long time-horizon the [volatility is not an issue](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/bitcoin-is-not-too-volatile/).
- *What happens if you put a small percent of your portfolio into Bitcoin?*  A small cost-averaged allocation to Bitcoin would have resulted in large gains in the volatility-adjusted performance of any portfolio.
- *How is Bitcoin’s volatility changing over time?*  As the Bitcoin market cap grows, Bitcoin is becoming less volatile as more liquidity is required to move the price

#### Bitcoin is manipulated by fraudulent whale and Tether trading
{: #is-manipulated-by-fraudulent }
- *What market doesn’t suffer from manipulation?*  All markets including commodities, currencies, and equities are manipulated by traders for profit, particularly if they have a small market cap.
- *How will Bitcoin be manipulated as more participants take self-custody?*  Since Bitcoin can be easily self-custodied compared to other assets, it is more difficult to manipulate or rehypothecate compared to similarly-sized assets.

#### Central bank digital currencies or corporate currencies will outcompete Bitcoin
{: #central-bank-digital-currencies }
- *How do centrally-issued currencies compete with Bitcoin?*  Bitcoin is scarce, uncensorable, unconfiscatible and can be self-custodied.  Centrally-issued currencies are none of these.  They cannot compete in the store-of-value niche Bitcoin and other assets fill.
- *What actually changes when fiat currency becomes digital?*  A move to central bank digital currency does not have any new monetary properties.  However it is a move towards centralized control and elimination of physical cash for citizens.
- *How can you achieve final settlement with a centrally issued currency?*  Bitcoin allows for final settlement between rivals, making it more like a commodity than a fiat digital currency.  Therefore it serves better as a reserve asset for nation-states than fiat currencies.
- See also: [Governments will stop Bitcoin](#governments-will-stop)

#### Newer decentralized cryptocurrencies will outcompete Bitcoin
{: #newer-decentralized-cryptocurrencies-will }
- *How can Bitcoin be displaced from its store-of-value niche?*  Bitcoin has the most security, guaranteed scarcity, and liquidity which makes it nearly [impossible to be displaced by another cryptocurrency for store-of-value](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/bitcoin-cant-be-copied/).
- *What gives a cryptocurrency value?*  Like all goods, cryptocurrency price is determined by the supply produced and the demand to be held or consumed.
- *Do other cryptocurrencies guarantee a supply issuance?*  Bitcoin provides the strongest supply schedule guarantees compared to more centralized cryptos that can be inflated through hard forks.
- *Is the demand for other cryptocurrencies justified?*  Many cryptos are used for speculative trading, not for store-of-value or their presumed utility.
- *What is the price performance of other cryptocurrencies since inception?*  Most other currencies have lost significant value compared to Bitcoin over time.

#### Surveillence, regulation and government control will render Bitcoin useless
{: #surveillence-regulation-and-government }
- *What and who does the regulation affect?*  Regulation and surveillance will affect some users in some countries doing specific things, but has no control over the Bitcoin network itself.
- *Who creates and enforces regulations?*  If citizens demand a level of financial privacy or choose civil disobedience en masse the regulations are unenforceable.  [Black markets flourish](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-change-insight/north-koreas-black-market-becoming-the-new-normal-idUSKCN0SN00320151029) under even the most oppressive regimes such as North Korea.
- See also: [Governments will stop Bitcoin](#governments-will-stop)

#### Bitcoin evades taxes
{: #evades-taxes }
- *How is Bitcoin different from other assets when it comes to taxes?*  Most countries treat Bitcoin as capital gains and just like other assets they regulate exchanges to collect taxes.
- *How much of a difference does Bitcoin make to the taxes governments collect?*  Most government revenues come from taxing sales, property, income, and capital gains.  Bitcoin is tiny compared to those.

#### Fiat currencies cannot collapse so we have no need for Bitcoin
{: #fiat-currencies-cannot-collapse }
- *Why do fiat currencies need to collapse in order for Bitcoin to function as a store-of-value?*  Bitcoin can serve as a life-raft in hyperinflation, but its success as a store-of-value doesn’t depend on it.
- *What causes the collapse of fiat currencies?*  The collapse of fiat currencies is usually caused by huge unpayable debts that were not restructured because of imprudent fiscal and monetary policies, not by speculation in commodities.

#### Guns and taxes back fiat currencies, Bitcoin is backed by nothing
{: #guns-and-taxes-back }
- *What about all the countries whose currency hyperinflated?*  Many countries have experienced hyperinflation or large devaluations of their currencies despite every one of them having guns and taxes
- *What about other commodities?*  Gold and gemstones have value despite being “backed by nothing.”  Gold is a reserve asset of most central banks, Bitcoin could serve a similar function as a neutral reserve asset.  Moreover, [Bitcoin is backed by its monetary properties](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/bitcoin-is-not-backed-by-nothing/) enforced by a massive computer network and army of developers and advocates.
- *Are taxes and threats the biggest drivers of currency demand?*  Militaristic empires can drive demand for a currency in the form of tribute payments and taxes, but in modern liberal economies trade and monetary policy are bigger factors

#### Bitcoin is unfairly distributed and rewards people for doing nothing
{: #is-unfairly-distributed-and }
- *What asset is more fairly distributed?*  Many things in the world such as land and fiat money are unfairly distributed using violence, but anyone can mine or earn Bitcoin
- *Shouldn’t the early risk-takers and contributors be rewarded?*  Like any enterprise, those who contributed the most when Bitcoin was risky and unproven were the most rewarded
- *What happens to Bitcoin owners if they do nothing productive?*  Bitcoin earns no rents, so over time people who provide nothing of value to others will be forced to sell their Bitcoin for living expenses

#### Disinflationary money breaks the economy so we cannot adopt Bitcoin
{: #disinflationary-money-breaks-the }
- *Why would using Bitcoin as a store-of-value have any effect on the existing debt system?*  Most debts are currently denominated in fiat currencies, adopting Bitcoin as a reserve asset has no effect on that.
- *What causes deflationary spirals?*  [Debt deflation crises](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-do-debt-crises-come-cycles-ray-dalio/) are caused by the build-up of huge interdependent debts within a centralized banking system.
- *How does an inflationary currency "cure" debt crises?*  Inflation is just another way to default on the debt, but [transfers wealth from savers and fixed-income pensioners to the rich who own real estate and other scarce assets](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/world-has-gone-mad-system-broken-ray-dalio/).
- *Is a debt system based on disinflationary money possible?*  Such systems existed for periods under gold standards and are stable if there are small periodic debt restructurings to avoid large debt build-ups.  Bitcoin’s auditability and self-custody properties make it superior to gold in preventing debt build-ups.

#### There's no merchant adoptance of Bitcoin so it is doomed
{: #theres-no-merchant-adoptance }
- *How does Bitcoin’s merchant adoption affect its use as a store-of-value?*  Most people use Bitcoin to store and transfer value, not pay for coffee.
- *Why would people spend money that is increasing in value rather than money that is decreasing in value?*  People would rather spend deprecating fiat money than appreciating money ([Gresham’s law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gresham%27s_law).)
- *How has merchant adoption of Bitcoin changed over time?*  [More merchants have been accepting Bitcoin over time](https://coinmap.org/view/#/world/-8.58102122/-58.00781250/2), particularly as new payment methods such as [Lightning](https://lightning.network/) and [Strike](https://strike.zaphq.io/) have made it easier to spend Bitcoin.  This trend simply needs to continue and like all network effects may exponentially lead to widespread merchant adoption.

#### Bitcoin is subjective, imaginary, a mass delusion
{: #is-subjective-imaginary-a }
- *How is the market value for anything determined?*  All prices for goods in a market including gemstones, Picassos, and fiat money are determined by market participants, Bitcoin is no different.
- *What about the actual computer network and labor that goes into Bitcoin?*  Bitcoin is a real computer network consisting of billions of dollars of infrastructure and millions of hours of contributions from engineers, cryptographers, and thinkers from around the world

#### Bitcoin is a cult, the people who believe in it are ideologues and maximalists
{: #is-a-cult-the }
- *How is Bitcoin more of a cult than a corporation or a national government?*  All large-scale human endeavors have ideological contributors.
- *What is the single position all Bitcoiners hold?*  Bitcoin proponents span a wide gamut from human right activists, Austrian economists, crypto-anarchists, technologists, futurists, and those just looking for speculative gains--it is hardly a dogmatic religion

#### Bitcoin uses too much energy, it’s bad for the environment
{: #uses-too-much-energy }
- *How do you determine what "too much" energy is for any good?*  Televisions, aircraft carriers, and plastic junk all require energy to produce, how much energy is too much for producing those?
- *What else would that energy be used for?*  Because of the competition between miners, Bitcoin mostly uses energy that would otherwise be wasted or nearly free such as overproduced hydroelectric.
- *What about Bitcoin’s negative carbon emissions?*  Bitcoin makes [capturing gas flaring](https://decrypt.co/41618/there-will-be-bitcoin-oil-gas-cash-cow-our-feet) profitable which incentivizes producers to reduce carbon emissions.  Low-carbon energy projects like hydroelectric, nuclear, or renewables can be made profitable by putting excess supply into Bitcoin mining.

#### Bitcoin is not programmable, as useful, or functional as other cryptocurrencies
{: #is-not-programmable-as }
- *How does programmability affect security?*  Bitcoin is designed to be the highest security monetary network, supporting general programming opens up possible security issues such as the ability for nodes to be decentralized
- *What about Bitcoin’s second layers?*  Second layers or improvements to the Bitcoin protocol can provide programmability such as RSK, discrete log contracts, and Lightning

#### Terrorists and drug dealers use Bitcoin
{: #terrorists-and-drug-dealers }
- *What percentage of Bitcoin usage is terorism and drug dealing?*  The vast majority of Bitcoin is used by ordinary people who want to save or speculate.
- *What about cars, cell phones, and bank accounts which are also used by them?*  Tools are only as good as the people who use them.  Bitcoin is not a special weapon that makes terrorists impossible to stop.
- *How is it easier to hide evidence on the blockchain compared to other methods?*  Hiding evidence on the blockchain is harder than hiding evidence by bribing a bank or exchanging art, gold, or banknotes.
