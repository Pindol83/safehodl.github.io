A [single hardware wallet used properly](/self-custody/) will protect you from most attacks except for:

- Losing all copies of your seed or passphrase
- An attacker getting your seed through coercion or theft
- Attacks from the hardware device itself

Multisig eliminates these threats since an attacker will need 2 or more of your seeds.  If you lose a seed you can still access your funds.  Here’s how to go about it:

**1. Choose a multisig solution.**  [Specter](https://specter.solutions/) is trustless but requires more effort to set up.  [Casa](https://keys.casa/) is easiest but takes a monthly fee.  [Unchained](https://unchained-capital.com/) takes a fee to sign if-needed.

**2.  Pick a M-of-N multisig where M is less than N, such as 2-of-3.**  Give yourself some leeway, a 2-of-2 requires all your backups to work perfectly.

**3.  Store your seeds in different locations.**  This way a thief cannot steal your Bitcoin even if they have access to a single location such as your house.

**4.  Backup your wallet info in all locations.**  Backup pubkeys from your multisig software in several locations, you’ll need them to recover if you lose a seed.

**5.  Practice recovery without one of your seeds.**  Using your pubkey backup, make sure you know how to recover your wallet using only 2 of your 3 seeds.

**6.  Avoid using devices from the same manufacturer.**  Do not expose yourself to risk from a single manufacturer.

**7.  Use devices that can verify multisig receive and change addresses.**  Your hardware wallet should store all the pubkeys in order to verify addresses such as the [ColdCard, CoboVault, and BitBox02](/hardware-wallets/).

A guide on how to use Specter + ColdCard + CoboVault can be [found here](https://btcguide.github.io/).
